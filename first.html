        <h2>Information about Flowers !!!</h2>
        <p>
            A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants. A flower is a special part of the plant. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.

            In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months.

            There are two types of pollination: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators

         Don't even try, to comfort me
         Keep your sad stories and just let me be
         Save your goodbyes, Don't watch me bleed
         By the time the sun rises, i'll be roaming free
         With the morning Breeze, i was right by your side
         But your arms released me, now I'm flying high
         With the morning breeze, how the time moves along
         And i'm no longer dreaming of days long gone
         But you know i still long, to hold onto you
         But gone are those days, cause your love was rude
         Take all your things and take the past with you
         Your selfish ways i cant wait to loose</pre>

         <h3>Red Dahlia Flower</h3>

         <pre style="font-size: 20px;font-family: Times, serif;"> <h3>MEDICAL IMPORTANCE OF FLOWER</h3>

            For several centuries, medical practitioners have long acknowledged the therapeutic properties of certain flowers. More than just spanning time, this knowledge also spans many cultures around the world. One of the greatest advantages is that flowers and plants offer completely natural medicinal properties, often without the scary side effects that modern pills and medications bring on. Furthermore, remedies made from flowers can be much cheaper than drugs marketed by pharmaceutical companies.

         The best places to obtain dried flowers or their essential oils is a herbal health store. Be careful when preparing tonics and other mixtures since some flowers can be very potent. Pregnant or nursing mothers in particular should consult with their doctor before using any essential oils. To learn more about using medicinal flowers for home remedies, have a look at some of the most effective ones below.
            
         **  Angelica Herb Remember the green bits of candied angelica used to decorate cakes? It comes from the very same plant as the Angelica flower. Like the rest of the plant, the flower is extremely fragrant and has a number of medicinal uses including digestive disorders and coughs and colds. It can also be given as a strengthening tonic for seniors and children.
            
         **  Begonias can be prepared in several different ways. An infusion made by soaking the flowers in hot water helps to eliminate headaches and rid the body of toxins. The crushed flowers and leaves can also be rubbed directly on the skin to help relieve pain and heal sores or burns.
           
         **  Lilacs can be steeped to make a tonic that reduces fever and to get rid of internal parasites. Skin burns or wounds are soothed and heal well when a paste or gel made from lilacs is applied.

         **  Lotus flowers are popular in both Eastern and Western cultures for their effectiveness against fever, diarrhea and also more serious illnesses such as cholera and bronchitis. A syrup made from the flower provides much relief for bad coughs.
            
         **  May Apples are extremely potent (even toxic) and should be used very carefully, preferably with the supervision of a professional herbalist. A small amount can be brewed as a tea or tonic to make a powerful laxative and can also bring on vomiting.
            
         **  Morning Glory Use caution not to ingest Morning Glory seeds as it could cause strong hallucinatory effects. The flower is used in several cultures as a laxative and general purge. Morning Glory also acts as an emmenagogue to bring on menstruation or labor.
            
         ** Nasturtium The anti-microbial properties of Nasturtium makes it an effective remedy against colds and flu. It is also useful in treating infections of the lungs, bladder and reproductive organs.
            
         ** Passionflower Passionflower contains medical properties best suited for treating disorders such as insomnia, agitation, anxiety, and epilepsy. It also acts on the nerves to reduce pain and induce a calming sensation.

         <br>
         <p>
            Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals, and all algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria).
        </p> 
        <p>
             By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants"), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae.
           Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
             Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common.
             There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260 - 290 thousand, produce seeds.

         <h2>Flower designing as a professional course </h2>
         <pre style="font-size: 20px;font-family: Times, serif;">
            <h3>People who do well in this career tend to share certain personal attributes and skills. Some of these include: </h3>

            Artistic Ability:  You need a strong sense of style and the ability to coordinate colors, decorations, and different types of plants and flowers for an aesthetically pleasing design.
            
            Creativity:  While artistic ability can sometimes be taught, creativity tends to be more of an inborn trait. As a floral designer, you use the skills you have learned to create designs appropriate to the occasion. You must be open to new ideas since trends can change quickly.
            
            Time Management:  Floral designing comes with a sense of urgency because the displays need to be completed on time for the special event. You need to consistently meet deadlines, or you will lose business and damage your reputation.
            
            Excellent Communication Skills:  You interact with customers and suppliers every day and need to know how to get your message across to each. With customers, you will explain different options for a floral design as well as how to care for the plants and flowers after the event. Since you will place orders with suppliers, you need to communicate exactly what you need and ask questions to ensure you understand what to expect in your order.
            
            Attention to Detail:  You must be careful about all the details that go into completing a customer's order. If a customer orders roses and you mistakenly ship carnations, you will have an unhappy customer that will not return to place another order or recommend you to friends and family.
            
            Independence:  Although you may work at a company and as part of a team, there will be many times (probably most of the time) that you will be required to work independently and develop your own unique way to doing things with innovation and creativity. This is especially true if you won your own shop or freelance.
            
            Concern for Others:  Floral designers often work with clients who are facing hardships or emotional times in their lives. Being sensitive to other's feeling and being understanding can be very helpful.
